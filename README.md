# MushOS

Execute with: `qemu-system-x86_64 -d guest_errors -vga std -drive format=raw,file=./cmake-build-debug/MushOS.img`
=======
MushOS is a UNIX-like OS prototype, written from scratch.  
My motivation for creating it was:
1. Research how computer works - on the deepest level of programming, where software meets hardware.
2. Trying to resolve some low-level issues I've always been wondering about (e.g.: inability to receive allocated memory amount from pointer).

Kernel code is stored in `core` directory, `lib` directory contains code for `mushlib` - an stdlib replacement for MushOS.  
MushOS roadmap:
1. Standalone bootloader 👍
2. Kernel code 👍
3. Keyboard + screen adapter 👍
4. MushLib basics 👍
5. GRUB loader booting 🤙
6. Kernel memory map 👎
7. File system (MushFS) + initrd 👎
8. Shell + audio drivers 👎
9. Multitasking 👎
10. User mode 👎
11. Video mode 👎
12. Sample apps 👎
13. etc...

Build using following command:  
`cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles" -S /home/milty/Documents/MushOS -B /home/milty/Documents/MushOS/cmake-build-debug`

Run using following command (qemu package required!):  
`qemu-system-x86_64 -d guest_errors -vga std -drive format=raw,file=cmake-build-debug/MushOS.img`
